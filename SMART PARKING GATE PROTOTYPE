This project focuses on creating an automated, efficient, and secure system using the Arduino platform. The prototype aims to demonstrate how technology can be used to enhance user experience and increase the security of parking spaces.
By integrating sensors and other electronic components, the smart parking gate will be able to detect the presence of vehicles, allow access only to authorized vehicles, and automatically close the gate after the vehicle passes. This solution will not only save time and effort but will also contribute to reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
